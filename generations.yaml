    description: "The Fiat 500X is a subcompact crossover SUV that combines 500-inspired styling cues with the practicality and higher ride height of an SUV. Built on the Small Wide 4Ã—4 platform shared with the Jeep Renegade, it represents Fiat's entry into the rapidly growing small crossover segment. The exterior design successfully translates the retro-inspired elements of the 500 city car onto a larger vehicle, featuring rounded headlights, a curved hood, and the distinctive Fiat front grille. Initially offered with a wide range of engines including 1.4L MultiAir turbocharged petrol units, 1.6L and 2.0L Multijet diesels, and a 2.4L Tigershark in North America, the powertrain lineup was later rationalized. A significant update in 2018 refreshed the styling and introduced new turbocharged engines in North America, including a 1.3L turbo producing 177 HP. The interior features a body-colored dashboard panel reminiscent of the standard 500, with a central touchscreen infotainment system that has been updated throughout the vehicle's life. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, the 500X offers more off-road capability than typical city-focused crossovers, particularly in Trekking and Cross variants. Throughout its production, the 500X has received minor updates to styling, technology, and equipment levels, but the fundamental design has remained consistent. A soft-top variant called the 500X Dolcevita was introduced in 2021, featuring a power-retractable canvas roof. The 500X represents Fiat's most successful expansion of the 500 design language beyond the original city car, providing a practical family vehicle with distinctive Italian style."
