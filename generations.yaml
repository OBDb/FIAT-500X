    description: "The initial Fiat 500X (Type 334) is a subcompact crossover SUV that combines 500-inspired styling cues with the practicality and higher ride height of an SUV. Built on the Small Wide 4×4 platform shared with the Jeep Renegade, it represents Fiat's entry into the rapidly growing small crossover segment. The exterior design successfully translates the retro-inspired elements of the 500 city car onto a larger vehicle, featuring rounded headlights, a curved hood, and the distinctive Fiat front grille. At launch, it offered a range of engines including 1.4L MultiAir turbocharged petrol units, 1.6L and 2.0L Multijet diesels. In North America, a 2.4L Tigershark was available. The interior features a body-colored dashboard panel reminiscent of the standard 500, with a central touchscreen infotainment system. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, the 500X offers more off-road capability than typical city-focused crossovers, particularly in Trekking and Cross variants."

The redesign launched new turbocharged engines including downsized 1.0L and 1.3L FireFly turbo units alongside updated diesel engines.

    description: "The 2022 restyling brought another round of updates including the introduction of a new 1.5L FireFly mild hybrid powertrain option with a 48V electric system. Visual updates to the exterior and interior styling continued the 500X's evolution. A soft-top variant called the 500X Dolcevita, featuring a power-retractable canvas roof, was also available during this period. This represents the final iteration of the first-generation 500X before production ended in August 2024, with the 500X eventually being succeeded by the Fiat 600."
